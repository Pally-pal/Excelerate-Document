# Excelerate-Document

A data-analysis / predictive-modeling project centered around dropout prediction using an Excel-derived dataset.  

## Repository Contents

- `Cleaned_Preprocessed_Data_ML.csv` — the cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for modeling.  
- `Excelerate_Dropoff_Predictive_Model_ Completed.py` — main Python script that builds/trains a predictive model for student dropout (or “dropoff”) based on the processed data.  
- `model_features.pkl` — serialized file storing the feature set or metadata used by the model.  
- `student_dropout_model.pkl` — serialized trained model for dropout prediction.  
- `model_predictions.csv` — output predictions generated by the model, for example on a test or new dataset.  
- `.readthedocs.yaml` — configuration for documentation hosting (if using Read the Docs or similar service).  
- `.gitignore` — defines ignored files/folders to keep repo clean.

## Purpose & Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can predict student dropout (or “dropoff”) based on a preprocessed dataset. The name “Excelerate-Document” reflects that the input data may originate from Excel or spreadsheet sources, but the project uses Python for processing, modeling, and prediction. Key aims are:

- Preprocess raw data into a clean, ML-ready format.  
- Train a predictive model that captures relationships between student attributes and dropout risk.  
- Serialize the trained model and feature metadata for reuse.  
- Apply the model to data and output predictions to a CSV file, enabling further analysis or integration.  

##  How to Use

1. Ensure you have a suitable Python environment (e.g., Python >= 3.7) with necessary dependencies installed.  
2. Place your raw data (if different) into CSV format and preprocess accordingly (or adapt preprocessing steps from the existing code).  
3. Run `Excelerate_Dropoff_Predictive_Model_ Completed.py`.  
   - This will load the cleaned data, train (or load) the model, and output predictions.  
4. The script produces:  
   - A trained model: `student_dropout_model.pkl`  
   - Feature metadata: `model_features.pkl`  
   - Predictions: `model_predictions.csv`  
5. You can load the model later for inference using Python’s `pickle` (or other serialization handler), given the correct feature schema.  

##  Project Structure & Workflow

Typical workflow:

1. Preprocess raw data → produce cleaned CSV.  
2. Run model script → train model or load existing model → output predictions.  
3. Use serialized model for future inference or integration with other systems.  

##  Dependencies

*(Add specific Python library versions here as appropriate for your project — e.g. pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.)*

Example:

- `pandas` — for data manipulation  
- `numpy` — numerical operations  
- `scikit-learn` — model training / evaluation / serialization  
- (any other libraries you used)  

You may freeze exact dependencies using a `requirements.txt` or similar.

##  Why “Excelerate-Document”?  

Although this project deals with predictive modeling in Python, the name suggests a processing pipeline from spreadsheet/Excel-derived data. This makes the project easily extensible for cases where data is initially stored or exported in Excel format: you can preprocess, clean, and feed the data into the modeling pipeline with minimal friction.  

##  Suggestions for Improvement / Future Work

- Add data-validation and cleaning steps (e.g. handling missing or inconsistent values) in a dedicated preprocessing module.  
- Include exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization scripts to better understand data distributions and feature importance.  
- Provide a command-line interface (CLI) or notebook interface for easier use.  
- Add documentation (e.g. README in `docs/`, docstrings, comments) for clarity and maintainability.  
- Version control for datasets and models (e.g. using DVC) if dataset size grows.
